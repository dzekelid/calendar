name: One Diary
description: One Diary is a service that allows you to share your work and personal
  calendars with people that are important to you. Both work and family life are requiring
  that they be more flexible in order to give their best to both. This inevitably
  means scheduling challenges as they juggle the demands of both. Knowing what their
  family is doing, and needs them to do, is fundamental if they are to make informed
  scheduling decisions.
